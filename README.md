🛒 E-Commerce App (Flutter UI Template)



A beautifully designed, comprehensive E-commerce application built with Flutter and Dart. 

>Note:
    Currently, this project serves as a Frontend UI Template. 
    The backend integration is not yet connected,
    making it the perfect boilerplate for developers looking to attach 
    their own custom backend APIs, Firebase, or Supabase.

✨ Features and Screens

    This application includes a complete set of fully designed screens required for a modern e-commerce experience:

    1 Authentication: Splash Screen, Login, Sign Up, and Forgot Password.
    2 Core Shopping:  Home Screen, Product List, Product Details, and Search Results.
    3 Cart & Checkout: Shopping Cart, Checkout Flow, and Order History.
    4 User Management: User Profile and Settings.
    5 Support & Extras: Help Center, Contact Page, Filter Screen, and App Sharing capabilities.
